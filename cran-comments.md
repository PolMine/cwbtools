## General remarks

The package has been removed from CRAN due to an ERROR resulting from a 
broken link for test data. I could not fix this issue in time. I would be very
glad if 'cwbtools' was back on CRAN soon.

This release also offers a workaround for functionality of the zen4R package 
that is currently not working.


## Test environments

* local macOS install, R 4.1.3
* GitHub Actions (Ubuntu 20.04, macOS, Windows) R 4.2.1
* win-builder (devel and release, R. 4.2.1)

## R CMD check results

On R winbuilder I see a NOTE on possibly misspelled words in the DESCRIPTION
file ("CWB" and "Hardie"), but that is correct.

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs on the Linux / macOS / Windows environments I used. 


## Downstream dependencies

None at this stage.
