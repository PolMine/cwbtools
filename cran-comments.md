## General remarks

The 'cwbtools' package concentrates and consolidates a set of functions and classes that were previously included in the 'polmineR' and the 'RcppCWB' package, or that were scattered across packages (I wrote) that were only available via GitHub.


## Test environments

## R CMD check results
