## General remarks

Improvements of the user interface with more telling status messages. This 
results in two new dependencies (cli, rstudioapi), but there is no tricky
issue I could anticipate.

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 4.0.0
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* Windows/AppVeyor, R 3.6.1 Patched
* win-builder (devel and release), R. 3.6.1


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs on the Linux / macOS environments I used. 


## Downstream dependencies

Checking not necessary at this time.
