## General remarks

The 'cwbtools' package concentrates and consolidates a set of functions and classes that were previously included in the 'polmineR' package, and the 'RcppCWB' package, and in other packages that were only available via GitHub.


## Test environments

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs on the Linux / macOS environments I used. 


## Downstream dependencies

I have also checked downstream dependencies using devtools::revdep(),
without seeing ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
