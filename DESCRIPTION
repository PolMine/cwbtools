Description: The 'Corpus Workbench' ('CWB', <http://cwb.sourceforge.net/>) offers a classic and mature
 approach for working with large, linguistically and structurally annotated corpora. The 'CWB'
 is memory efficient and its design makes running queries fast (Evert and Hardie 2011,
 <http://www.stefan-evert.de/PUB/EvertHardie2011.pdf>). The 'cwbtools' package offers
 pure R tools to create indexed corpus files as well as high-level wrappers for the original C
 implementation of CWB as exposed by the 'RcppCWB' package
 <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppCWB>. Additional functionality to add and
 modify annotations of corpora from within R makes working with CWB indexed corpora
 much more flexible and convenient. The 'cwbtools' package in combination with the R packages
 'RcppCWB' (<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppCWB>) and 'polmineR'
 (<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polmineR>) offers a lightweight infrastructure
 to support the combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches for working
 with textual data.
